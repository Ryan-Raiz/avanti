It's gotten dark already and Nadja was peacefully sleeping in the passenger seat.</p> <p>For about an hour a black BMW with Hungarian licence plates were driving behind them. They were approaching Vienna, so Arthur decided to stop at the next gas station, get some coffee and refuel the car. It was a good chance to see if they had a tail.</p> <p>After another 10 minutes they approached the gas station. Arthur drove in and got out of the car to get the fuel. BMW didn't follow, it passed by and drove away. After fueling the car, he opened the passenger door:</p> <ul><li>Let's go get some coffee.</li> <li>I'm not in the mood for coffee - she said</li> <li>We'll get you something else then. Let's go, I cannot leave you alone in the car - it's dangerous.</li></ul> <p>They went to the gas station paid for the gas and got coffee for Arthur and Red Bull for Nadja.</p> <ul><li>You don't want to sleep anymore? - he asked</li> <li>I think I got enough sleep for now. I would rather stay awake now. Who knows - maybe you will need some help.</li> <li>I'm glad to have some company - he smiled at her</li></ul> <p>In half an hour they should reach Vienna. They drove off the gas station and on the road to Vienna. After another 10 minutes of driving Arthur saw the same black BMW in the rear mirror.</p> <ul><li>I think we have tail again. Since it's gotten dark already they may have to take some action against us - be prepared. We'll driving off the road.</li></ul> <p>Arthur turned on 4-wheel drive mode, dropped some speed and spun the steering wheel really hard.</p> <ul><li>What are you doing?</li> <li>We have some advantage on the unpaved road due to the 4-wheel-drive - hold on tight.</li></ul> <p>He pushed the pedal to metal. They were doing around 140 km/h on an unpaved road. BMW was still keeping relatively close behind them. He saw the hand with the gun getting out of the window.</p> <ul><li>Get down.</li></ul> <p>Shots were fired. Some hit the rear part of the car. Arthur hoped that the wheels haven't been hit yet. They need to get off the unpaved road to the grass or a forest - they'll have more chances there.</p> <p>Nadja was scared as hell again but the good thing was that she was silent.Arthur was steering towards the small piece of forest that was about 1 kilometer away.</p> <ul><li>There should be a gun somewhere in the glove box - get it out - fast.</li></ul> <p>Nadja opened the glove box and started looking for a gun.</p> <ul><li>I don't see anything - she said</li></ul> <p>The shot were fired again. One bullet missed Nadja's head by a couple of millimeters. Arthur threw everything out of the glove box and found a hidden compartment. He found a G17 Glock inside.</p> <ul><li>Ok, if we'll get stuck, we will have to get out of the car. Be prepared, just in case.</li></ul> <p>He saw a road branching out into the forest. He took it and increased the speed. The road was wet and muddy - just perfect. The shot have been fired again - the bullets were flying close to the car.</p> <ul><li>This road ends in about 500 meters. Prepare to get out of the car.</li></ul> <p>The BMW was falling behind but the advantage was only around 20-30 seconds. They could either try to get into a defensive position at the car or try to get lost in the woods. Getting into the defense, wasn't really an option. They didn't know what weapons the guys in BMW had and they didn't have enough bullets to be sure about the outcome of the potential shooting.</p> <p>They stopped at the end of the road and got out of the car.</p> <ul><li>Follow me! We have to get lost in the forest.</li></ul> <p>BMW got stuck about 500 meters away from them. Two guys got out of the car and started running towards the entry into the forest.</p> <p>Arthur and Nadja were moving as fast as they could.</p> <ul><li>We won't be able to outrun them, so you will need to hide and I will take care of them.</li></ul> <p>It's gotten dark already, all cats already got grey. Hiding was easier. Arthur showed Nadja to hide under a large pine tree. He covered her with fallen pine branches and moved silently into the forest.</p> <ul><li>I only hope they don't have night or thermal vision goggles - talked Arthur to himself</li></ul> <p>He needed to get behind the pursuers for an effective attack. He moved almost silently. Spending most of his childhood exploring the woods and the mountains, he was stealthy to his enemies.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
