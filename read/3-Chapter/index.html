He went to
the kitchen and fill the big glass with tap water. One tablet of ibuprofen
works wonders. He took on and went to the shower. At 5:30am he was ready to go.
The ibuprofen started to work and the headache softened. It needed another 15
minutes to disappear completely. He knew the coffee will weaken the ibuprofen
effect but he needed his morning dose.</p> <p>He still had some time to check the local news. He hoped to not find anything
about a dead body found in Marriot at Russian Hill.

Hotel. Do you know this feeling when in the back of your head there's still
a hope that someone made a mistake or that maybe, just maybe it's someone else and not your friend.</p> <p>He started to feel a bit dizzy but he knew that he has to keep a clear head. He needed to calm down and concentrate. The door bell got him back to consciousness. He went to the door and looked through the peephole. That was Vlad.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Why are you ringing the door bell - it's your house.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;I am a well-brought-up boy üòÑ. Are you ready? We cannot miss the flight
and we cannot let your flight buddy wait. Have you checked the news?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Yes, I did. Do you think it's about her?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;The chances for the opposite are very low - you know that it's quite unrealistic that someone else died in the same
hotel at the same day. But don't think about it. Get your bag and let's
get going.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Ok, give me a second.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>He went to the kitchen and got some water then walked back into the room, shut
his Mac and put it into the backpack.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;I'm ready let's go.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>He put his stuff on the backseat of the car and they drove off to the airport.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;How was your night?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Mine was awesome as usual - did you expect something else? üòÅ&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Not really but I still cannot understand how you can deal with the people
here and have fun.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;It's your soviet childhood talking. I would rather talk to someone, who you
would probably call <code>shallow</code>, but who's fun and enjoys life than spending
time somewhere in a shitty kitchen in a small shitty soviet apartment
talking with very smart but wasted people about mistakes Nazi Army made
during World War II. Leave your old school way of thinking behind and
finally start enjoying the life.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;I'm having hard time talking to people who don't know history or geography
and acting as if they were the center of the world.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;It doesn't work like in the movies, mate, it neve did. Good guys or smartest guys
don't win. Ignorant, stupid people who take action win. They don't know
history, they create it. Yes, the quality of people dropped significantly
lately - god bless tech, but let's be honest 90% of the people are dumb and
were dumb always. Smart people are <code>outliers</code> - they're not a normality.
That's one of the reasons the system doesn't like them. They're hard to
control, they're unpredictable.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>When they arrived at the Oakland International, Jet was ready to go. Vlad was
faster to say bye:</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Take care, mate and don't beat yourself about what happened - it's not
your fault.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;I feel stupid to say thank you again but thank you!&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Don't thank me. As long as we're on the same side of the war, I'm here to
help. We'll see how it will look later.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>They hugged and he went to the terminal. The girls was already waiting for him
with the name shield. He went straight to her:</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Good morning, I'm Arthur. You look great today!&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Oh, good morning Mr. Arthur. The jet is ready, please follow me.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>They went through the building to the airfield, get into a golf cart
and started driving towards the jet. When they went up the he was greeted by the pilots and his flight
companion - Thomas. Thomas was a  good-looking half German, half Hungarian entrepreneur from
Budapest who was also living in Munich part time. It was quite convenient - they could speak either English or German. Arthur was fluent in both
languages but preferred to speak English whenever he couldn't use his mother tongue.</p> <p>Even after spending majority of his life in Germany but being a boy from Leningrad he still couldn't forgive the Germans

bodies and use their meat as food to survive.</p> <p>Every little boy from Leningrad grew up with staples of books that showed the pictures
of streets of Leningrad covered with snow that had sledges with dead bodies.</p> <p align="center" width="100%"><img align="center" width="50%" src="https://tmora.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Siege.jpg"></p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Thank you very much for taking me with you. It's really hard to get to
Europe at the moment with almost all countries being locked down and the
airlines cancelling most of the flights.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Absolutely no problem. It's even better than I don't have to fly alone.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;I would love to keep you company but I have to get some sleep. If you
would excuse me for a couple of hours I would try to rest for a bit and we
can spend some time together before the landing.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Sure, no worries - I have a lot of work to do anyways and the flight time
is the best possible time to use for work - nobody is disturbing you. Let's
see if I will be awake when you will wake up üòÄ.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>He knew he won't be able to fall asleep immediately but he needed some rest-
the time after the landing will be short and intense. He will have to find out
what has happened in San Francisco and who was trying to set him up. The talks
about Russian intervention in the US election campaign haven't stopped for the
last 4 years but all the accusations were blatant manipulative lies without any
evidence.</p> <blockquote><p>After the fall of Soviet Union, USA factually lost its only enemy, so driven
by the fairy tales of Hollywood and Marvel comic books, they invented new
enemies for the people but the state still needed one.
So after some trial and error they re-invented Russia as an enemy in early
2000s.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>US attempted to completely destroy the biggest part of the former USSR - Russian Federation. Drug and people trafficking- the social impact was immense. Life expectancy fell, with up to five million excess adult deaths in Russia in 1991-2001, birth rates collapsed.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Even after Russia reestablished itself, US continued with the efforts to
undermine it by widening the NATO and eventually creating an anti-Russia out of Ukraine by going full in and
leading the Coup D'Etat in 2014 by killing people on both sides and using the
help of right wing extremists on supporting the newly created government</p></blockquote> <p>His travel companinon was deeply concetrated on his work - at least that's how
it looked like since he was staring on his notebook and fast typing something
on his keyboard. Does he have to get suspicious - no, bullshit Vlad couldn't
have set him up.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Could I get a glass of whiskey, please?&quot; - he asked the flight hostess&gt;</li> <li>&quot;Yes, sir, sure. We have Macallan, Tallisker and Higland Park - which one
do you prefer?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Higland Park, please.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>She returned with a glass of whiskey. Jet was ready to take off.</p> <p>He put the glass on the table and fastened the seatbelt.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
