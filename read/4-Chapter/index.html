His co-traveler peacefully slept
on his chair.</p> <p>He called the flight hostess asked her for a coffee and went to the restroom.
He needed to freshen up after a long flight. He had to be ready to act once the
jet has landed. He won't have a lot of time in Budapest. If someone was trying
a matter of time until they try to get to him again.</p> <p>So he needed to find his contact in Budapest quickly. Back in
SF Vlad told him that Serge is the person to talk to. He may potentially have
some ideas about people who are trying to set him up. He is the new man in
town - the one from the mother ship.</p> <p>Vlad worked with Serge hand in hand for almost a year before he moved to San Francisco. He was handing over Budapest to him - introducing him to all his contacts and revealing all the secret spots. It was a regular procedure whenever a <code>city owner</code> was replaced.</p> <p>So, once they land he will be heading to <a href="https://gerbeaud.hu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Café Gerbeaud<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="outbound-link-title" role="img" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><title id="outbound-link-title">(opens new window)</title> <path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> to meet with Serge. He had to find out something about the call from Budapest. He didn't expect to get clear answers but he hoped to know who's currently actively doing any work in Hungary.</p> <p>Touch down was smooth. It was raining outside - the weather he's used to since
he was a kid. His travel companion just woke up.</p> <ul><li>Hey man! How was your sleep?</li> <li>I'm happy that I could get some of it. Was working almost the full flight
through. You were sleeping like a baby btw.</li> <li>Yes, I had a couple of rough days prior to that and needed some sleep.</li> <li>Do you want to join me? I'll have cab waiting for me. We can take you to the
city center.</li> <li>That's very kind of you but my friend is already waiting for me at the
airport.</li> <li>No worries, maybe next time.</li></ul> <p>Pilot announced that they can leave the plane. Arthur left the plane
saying good bye to his new acquaintance and rushed to the airport building. He
passed through the border control and went straight to the taxis outside of the
airport building. There was no queue - it was still pretty early in the
morning. He got into the first cab and said the address that was 5 blocks away
from his actual destination. The driver doesn't need to know where he's
heading - the less traces he leaves the better. That's why he never used UBER
or other mobility providers.</p> <p>After around 40 minutes of driving, he got of at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HZzWGBmWhvyg5uQT7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dohány Street

From here he needed around
10 minutes to the coffee shop. Although he mind was constantly busy, he really
enjoyed walking the streets of this beautiful city. It reminded him of all the
countless walks he took when he was growing up in Saint-Petersburg.</p> <p>He entered to Café, went straight to the counter, ordered an espresso and asked
for Serge. The barista told him to take a seat at a window. After 2 minutes the
waitress brought him his coffee. There was a small piece of paper with the
phone number underneath the saucer. He made a phone call. The bot on the other
end asked him for his name. After he went through a set of questions, the

He ripped the piece
of paper in small pieces and threw it into the trash bin. He didn't take the
straigt way along the river but a detour through the smaller streets doing
a lot of turns - it was way easier to check if someone was following him.</p> <p>He arrived at the bridge and started walking towards <a href="https://www.contiki.com/six-two/buda-vs-pest-which-side-of-the-river-are-you-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buda<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="outbound-link-title" role="img" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><title id="outbound-link-title">(opens new window)</title> <path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.
He knew his phone will start buzzing when Serge will be near him. He walked
slowly making stops and enjoying the view from the bridge - he wasn't in
a rush. About half way in his phone started buzzing but there was nobody near
him - he looked to the other side of the bridge and saw a woman walking to
Buda. He followed her but kept walking on his side. He knew he had to get to
the other side at the and of the bridge, otherwise he won't be able to follow
the girl anymore. Once he was close to the end he waited the road to get empty
and rushed to the other side. He saw that the girl slowed down a bit helping
him to follow her. She walked off the bridge, took the firs left where the
parking was. She walked straight to her car, got it and started the engine. He
get into the car on the passenger seat and she immediately started driving.</p> <ul><li>Who are you? - he asked</li> <li>I will bring you to Serge.</li></ul> <p>They drove along the Danube in the early dusk not talking. He felt calm as if
all of a sudden he was in a safe place, just enjoying the ride through the
night city.

3 minutes and rang the bell - the door opened. He walked in and heard the voice
from above saying:</p> <ul><li>Go all the way up - third floor!</li></ul> <p>Arthur went up to the last floor. A middle-aged man was waiting for him in the

murder of my friend.</li> <li>Are you sure, she was murdered? Did you see her body?</li> <li>Not personally but I saw the news about the murder.</li> <li>You know, the news don't mean shit. We create news ourselves.</li> <li>Yes, I know, but these weren't the news from us.</li> <li>It doesn't matter it's the same all around the globe - you cannot trust the
news anymore - Serge took a sip of whiskey - What's the phone number you got
called from?</li> <li>Here it is - Arthur reached his mobile phone to Serge - I have another
question - who's currenlty working in the city?</li> <li>The usual suspects: Americans, Russian, some Brits, Germans and lately more
and more Ukranians, though I'm not sure they are to be taken seriously - I'd
say only if they work for Brits, Americans or Germans. Oh, yeah, there're some
Croatians as well.</li> <li>Who do you think could call and warn me?</li> <li>I have no clue to be honest. I wouldn't even be sure that the call was made
from Budapest.</li> <li>Could you, please, try to find out for me who could that be - or at least
who's currently the most active ones in the city.</li> <li>Sure, I'll try to find something out for you. By the way: are you sure your
friend is dead?</li> <li>I've seen it on the news.</li> <li>Have you seen the body? Have you seen her name on the news? I don't have to
tell you that we live in the post-truth-time - you shouldn't believe anything
you haven't heard or seen yourself.</li> <li>No but I don't think there were multiple accidentes in the same hotel on this
day. Plus, I got a call if you remember.</li> <li>Yes, I do remember and that's exactly what makes me suspicious. Do you wanna

of Budapest and mentally taking some time off of the problems he unintenionally
got in. He still had no clue, who could want to set him up and why. He was also
thinking about Sergey's words that as long as he hasn't seen the body of Sasha
himself, he cannot be sure that she's dead.</p> <p>He had good memories about Budapest. He remembered how they were roaming the
streets of the city together with Vlad before he trasfered to SF.</p> <p>Thinking about the past and the present, he reached the hotel. He got the keys
at the counter and went up to his room. He dropped the bag on the bed, took his
clothes off and went to the shower.</p> <p>After he got out of the shower, he put on new clothes and put the dirty ones in
the <code>cleaning</code> bag. It was time for a drink. He took his phone, his wallet and
the key-card from the room. He went downstairs into the hotel bar and ordered an old fashioned.
He finished it quickly, put it on his room and left the hotel. He needed to get outside.
He decided to walk until he finds another bar. He was hoping to get his head clean, to get some
fresh perspective on the situation he's currently in. He wasn't sure anymore if Sasha was dead or not.
He didn't find out who was calling him from Budapest and why. Someone was playing a game with him
the rules of which he doesn't know.</p> <p>He was walking passed an Irish Pub and decided to go in. He went straight to the bar and ordered a Guinness.
He hasn't done 2 sips yet when a girl sat next to him.</p> <ul><li>Hi! It was a beautiful long haired brunette in a dark, tight dress and a leather jacket.</li> <li>Hi! Do we know each other?</li> <li>I'm Nadja. What is your name?</li> <li>Hi Nadja! I hear a light South German or Austrian accent.</li> <li>Austrian. Do you speak German?</li> <li>Ja, das tue ich - but it's not the language I prefer. If you don't mind, I'll continue in English. What brings such a beautiful lady as yourself to talk to such an average guy like me?</li> <li>You looked lost but cute when you came in.</li> <li>Is that a reason to come and talk to a guy?</li> <li>If you like him - yes.</li> <li>Thank you! It's very nice of you but I'm not in the mood right now.</li> <li>Will you take my number? I'd love you to call me some time - she smiled at him beautifully.</li> <li>I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood. I'm really not.</li> <li>Give me you phone - you won't regret it</li></ul> <p>Arthur unlocked his phone and slid it to Nadja. She took it and called herself.</p> <ul><li>What are you doing?</li> <li>Calling you.</li></ul> <p>She put the phone to her year. Arthur's phone started buzzing. He looked at his screen.</p> <ul><li>Where did you get this phone? - he sounded really angry - Who are you?</li></ul> <p>He grabbed her hand, took her cell phone and put it in his pocket. He threw the money on the bar counter and started to drag her out of the bar.</p> <ul><li>We need to get out of here fast. Where did you get this phone from?</li> <li>A guy outside of the bar gave it to me. He paid me 500 euros to talk to you and to call you from this phone</li></ul> <p>Arthur was walking fast pushing off people that were on his way. Shortly before the exit a guy tried to stop him. Arthur kicked him off his legs and continued to walk.</p> <p>They ran out outside and kept walking really fast to not draw any attention. Arthur was faster, so he was almost dragging Nadja over the pavement.</p> <ul><li>Can you walk a bit slower - she asked - I'm on high heels, I cannot walk that fast.</li> <li>We have to get some place safe as fast as possible. Keep walking close to me - it's safer for you.</li> <li>Why should I trust you?</li> <li>Do you have anyone else you can truly trust right now? If I will let you go, they will probably get rid of you.</li> <li>Who are them?</li></ul> <p>Arthur was looking for a cab although he wasn't sure the driver won't be one of the people who sent Nadja to him. The were walking pass the pizza shop that offered deliveries. He saw a courier on a scooter that just came back from the customer and was walking to pick up the next one. He jumped on the scooter, shouted to Nadja to get on and they rode away. He needed to get out of the city fast but he also wanted to find out who was behind this all.</p> <p>Arthur rode to Sergey taking smaller streets and checking for the tail. They stopped 3 blocks away from Sergey's appartment, left the scooter on the pavement walked into the closest coffee shop and sat at a table.</p> <ul><li>Please, order something for yourself. Get me an espresso. Try to act normally. I have to make a call.</li></ul> <p>He walked outside and called Sergey.</p> <ul><li>Don't talk just listen. I have the phone I've been called from when I was in SF. I need you to find out who the sim card is registered to. I also need a car to get out of the country - something low-key. I'll have to take a girl with me. I'll share my location with you. Be fast - the sooner we'll get out of Hungary, the better. Bye!</li></ul> <p>He went back it and took a sip of coffee.</p> <ul><li>Italian espresso is much better.</li></ul> <p>He saw that Nadja was shaking. He took her hand.</p> <ul><li>Try to relax. I know that you're afraid - don't be. We'll take care of you.Do you have your passport with you?</li> <li>No. Why?</li> <li>We'll have to leave the country - it's not safe to stay here for you. I will drive you to Austria. Where should I drop you off? It's better if you don't stay at your home - they can get to you.</li> <li>I don't think I'll feel safe back in Austria. Can I go with you?</li> <li>It won't be safe with me either. But I can take you with me to Hamburg.</li></ul> <p>Arthur's phone buzzed. It was Sergey. Arthur went to the bar and paid.</p> <ul><li>Get up - we have to leave.</li></ul> <p>They went out of the coffee shop and started walking.</p> <ul><li>Where are we going?</li> <li>We need to get a car. Just keep walking.</li></ul> <p>He checked his phone. Sergey was approaching. A small, white SUV stopped and Sergey got out.</p> <ul><li>The papers are in the glove box. Where is the mobile phone?</li> <li>Here you go. Please, try to find out as much as you can - when was the sim card bought, who was it registered to - anything you can. Contact me as soon as you know anything.
He turned to Nadja.</li> <li>Get in the car. We gotta go.</li></ul> <p>They got into the car and started driving. It will take them around 40 minutes to get out of the city. It was starting to get dark. Budapest was glowing.</p> <ul><li>Stunning city. I will definitely come back - thoughts were flying through Arthur's head. The longer he will drive the calmer he will get.</li></ul></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
