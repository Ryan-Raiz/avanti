He decided to take
a walk to Sasha's hotel with a quick stop at a coffee shop.</p> <p>The weather was splendid and he enjoyed the walk through the morning streets of San Francisco. His mind was calm but in the back of his mind he was still analyzing his yesterday's encounter.</p> <p>He got the coffee to go at ... and went to the hotel to meet Sasha. He walked
into the lobby of Mariott at 8:45am and went straight to the reception.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Good Morning!&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Good Morning, Sir. How can I help you?&quot; - the gay guy at the counter was
smiling at him</li> <li>&quot;I'm here to meet my friend Alexandra Schwartz. Could you, maybe, give her
a call and tell her that her friend is waiting in the lobby?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Sure Sir. Your name is?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Arthur, Arthur Such.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Give me a moment, sir.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>He took a step back and looked around the lobby. There wasn't anything
suspicious. All of sudden his mobile phone started to vibrate. He pulled it out
of his pocket: <code>Unknown number from Budapest? That's weird.</code></p> <p>Normally he wasn't answering calls from unknown numbers but something back in
his mind convinced him he should take it this time</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Yeah&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Just listen!&quot; - the voice was coming through a distortion device
&quot;I know that you're standing in the lobby of a Mariott in SF waiting for your
friend. She's dead. Someone is trying to set you up, you have to get out.&quot;
&quot;Who the fuck are..&quot; - the call was over.</li></ul></blockquote> <p>He went straight to the counter. He was trying to sound calm.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Sorry mate I got an important call and have to leave immediately. Could
you, please, tell Alexandra that I will call her later.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Sure, Sir. I couldn't reach her but I will leave a note for her from you.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p><code>Ok, he couldn't reach her. Maybe she was just taking a shower.</code> He was hoping
that the caller from Budapest was wrong but if he wasn't - he relly have to get
out of the country and he has to do it rather fast.</p> <p>He walked out of the building and went towards the pier. He needed to blend in
with the crowd and make a call.
Who the fuck has warned him. How did he get his number and how did he know where is he or who he's about to meet with.</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>I guess &quot;someone was following me yesterday&quot; wasn't just a feeling.
They probably saw me talking to Sasha in the coffee shop. Ok,

happened and what he should do next. Back in his head he was still thinking
about the call he received this morning - <code>who the could that have been?</code>. He had
a peculiar feeling that it won't be the last time he will get a call from this person.</p> <p>He saw Vlad from far, he looked fresh as always - tanned with white surfer hair
he obviously enjoyed his new life in California. Sipping on his coffee or tea,
he was chatting on the phone. Once he spotted Arthur, he waved his hand showing
the direction and started walking. They met in around 50 metres and walked
together.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Where are we going?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;To my car. It's very nice seeing you, man. How have you been?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Great until today's morning. How are you?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;I'm awesome dude. I love it here. The weather is great, the nature is
amazing - terrific place.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Don't you miss Europe - all the history and culture?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;C'mon man, we grew up in the same place, you remember how we were dragged
to the museums and theaters and philarmonies when we were kids - I'm tired
of it. And let's be honest nowadays Europe is kinda almost the same
everywhere - it's become either a Middle East or North Africa almost
everywhere&quot; - he smiled. &quot;Get into the car&quot;.</li></ul></blockquote> <p>They got into Vlad's white Miata and drove to Vlad's house.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Ok, tell me what's the problem? What brings you to uncle Vlad.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;I think I'm in a deep shit.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Again? What's happened this time? What law did you break? Did you kill
someone?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;You know I would never do. I think someone is trying to set me up.  Imet
a girl yesterda...&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Here we go - all the fucking problems you straight guys have are because
of the pussy. Was it at least worth it? 😂&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Vlad, it's not fucking funny. I met Sasha from Munich, you remember, I was
telling you about her in Budapest.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;The girl you were working with in Munich, right, when you were building
your legend.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Exactly. I had to meet her for a walk today in the morning. I alread y was
in the lobby of her hotel and got a call from, funny-funny, Budapest.
Whoever was on the other end told me that Sasha is dead and I should get
out of there. So, I asked the guy at the desk to cal her but she didn't
answer. Now, I have to get out of the country and probably not under the
name I entered US - just in case.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>They arrived at Vlad's house, parked the car and went inside.</p> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Palace+of+Fine+Arts,+3601+Lyon+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94123,+Vereinigte+Staaten/1401+48th+Ave,+San+Francisco,+CA+94122,+USA/@37.7820113,-122.4955958,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x808586d510144681:0xe960db8a581aacf5!2m2!1d-122.4486055!2d37.8020068!1m5!1m1!1s0x80858796bd4ef215:0xabaaaba699627164!2m2!1d-122.5082746!2d37.7601747!3e0?authuser=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="/avanti/assets/img/PalaceOfArts-48thAvenue.abfc2a8f.png" alt="Vlad's Home"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="outbound-link-title" role="img" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><title id="outbound-link-title">(opens new window)</title> <path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Do you want a drink, cause I need one to relax a bit and think.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;I'd get an IPA, I know you have one.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Sure, serve yourself - there's plenty in the fridge.

it was one of our guys?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;You've been with the <code>mothership</code> long enough and should know that there's no such
thing as <code>our guys</code>. We have a very good relationship with you but when the Mothership will force
me to choose between my ass and yours, I will prefer mine any time of the day - I like my ass 😉. Most of <code>our guys</code> will do the same. Ok, I'm going out tonight, my extremely handsome friends are waiting to celebrate my dance moves. I'll pick you up at 6am tomorrow. Try to get some rest.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Sure, please, go enjoy yourself. I'll try to get some sleep. It's been
a rough couple of days.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Thanks dad but I don't need your permission. I'm a grown up proud gay boy
😄. Ok, mate, see you in the morning.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>Vlad left his unfinished glass of red wine in the kitchen, took his keys and the
wallet and set off.</p> <p>Arthur spent some time just sitting on the couch thinking about the past day drinking some beers and just
trying to <code>relax</code> until he started to fall asleep.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
