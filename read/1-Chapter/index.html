The sun was setting down and the city started to look nicer.</p> <p>He looked out of the window. The crackhead was still hanging around at the bus

really think secret services (at least the serious ones) do give names to their

Mission Street to the harbor.</p> <p>Growing up in Leningrad - the city built in the worst part of the Russian
Empire on more than 30 islands, he always felt drawn to the cities built on
water. The time spent in Hamburg only contributed to it.</p> <p>He reached the pier and turned left - he needed a longer walk. Althogh he was
pretty deep in his thoughts he had the feeling that someone is following him.</p> <p>He didn't take his phone with him, so UBER wasn't an option. &quot;Even better so,
he thought&quot;. He knew he could get nervous and who knows what the UBER drive
would be able to remember.</p> <p>Walking along the pier, he was thinking about the ways to find out whether
someone was following him or not. The easiest way was to walk into the coffee
shop or a bar to see if the guy will follow him inside or maybe stay outside
and wait for him.</p> <p>He decide to get to Embarcadero and go to one of the cafes or bars that were

and sat down at the table at the window to see if his <code>new friend</code> will follow
him inside. Nobody followed. The waitress came to his table and as he was
ordering his coffee, someone tapped on his shoulder. He turned around:</p> <ul><li><code>Sasha, what the heck are you doing here?</code> - he stood up and gave her three
kisses. He was really surprised to see her in US. They met 5 years ago in Munich.</li> <li><code>I'm in town for the project we launch in US. I wasn't expecting to meet you here, I thought you finally moved to Portugal.</code></li> <li><code>Yeah, I almost did but then some other projects appeared on the horizon and I couldn't resist. Do you wanna stay here and get a coffee or do we want to get things to go and go for a walk?</code>
When they met, he just started to create his <code>legend</code> of being a serial
entrepreneur turning VC/startup consultant. He was advising the company Sasha
was working for, so they were working pretty close together for 3 months. He
liked her a lot. Portugal was part of his legend with the exception that deep
inside he was longing for the simple life and heartwarming people he met there
in his previous life.</li></ul> <p>He got carried away and forgot about his <code>stalker</code> for a brief moment.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Have you seen me from the outside?&quot; - he asked. He just wanted to make sure
that he didn't took her for his follower - usual paranoia, you know.</li> <li>&quot;No, I sat at a table in front of the place, when you rushed past me and got
inside.&quot;</li></ul></blockquote> <p>They spent an hour talking then grabbed the coffee to go and walked out.</p> <blockquote><ul><li>&quot;Where are you staying?&quot; - he asked</li> <li>&quot;<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ry8J9v76ZPL1nkZB6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariott<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-labelledby="outbound-link-title" role="img" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><title id="outbound-link-title">(opens new window)</title> <path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> at Russian Hill.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Wanna meet tomorrow for a breakfast and a stroll?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Yes, I'd love to.&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Do you want me to meet you tomorrow in the lobby of you hotel around 9am?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;That sounds great! Ok, my UBER is here.&quot;
She hugged him and rushed to her car.</li></ul></blockquote> <p>He got back to his hotel trying to analyze whether meeting Sasha in US was
suspicious. Yes, she was working for a big international insurance enterprise with offices all around the world and yes they could potentially launch a new product in US but since he started to work for <code>Mom</code>, he became overly suspicious and let's be honest he never believed in serendipity.</p> <p>He needed to dig deeper to understand what going on.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
