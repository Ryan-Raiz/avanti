# Chapter 4
He woke up a couple of hours before landing. His co-traveler peacefully slept
on his chair.

He called the flight hostess asked her for a coffee and went to the restroom.
He needed to freshen up after a long flight. He had to be ready to act once the
jet has landed. He won't have a lot of time in Budapest. If someone was trying
a matter of time until they try to get to him again.

So he needed to find his contact in Budapest quickly. Back in
SF Vlad told him that Serge is the person to talk to. He may potentially have
some ideas about people who are trying to set him up. He is the new man in
town - the one from the mothership.

Vlad worked with Serge hand in hand for almost a year before he moved to San Francisco. He was handing over Budapest to him - introducing him to all his contacts and revealing all the secret spots. It was a regular procedure whenever a `city owner` was replaced.

So, once they land he will be heading to [Café Gerbeaud](https://gerbeaud.hu/) to meet with Serge. He had to find out something about the call from Budapest. He didn't expect to get clear answers but he hoped to know who's currently actively doing any work in Hungary.

Touch down was smooth. It was raining outside - the weather he's used to since
he was a kid. His travel companion just woke up.

- Hey man! How was your sleep?
- I'm happy that I could get some of it. Was working almost the full flight
  trhrough. You were sleeping like a baby btw.
- Yes, I had a couple of rough days prior to that and needed some sleep.
- Do you want to join me? I'll have cab waiting for me. We can take you to the
  city center.
- That's very kind of you but my friend is already waiting for me at the
  airport.
- No worries, maybe next time.

Pilot announced that they can leave the plane. Arthur left the plane
saying good bye to his new acquaintance and rushed to the airport building. He
passed through the border control and went straight to the taxis outside of the
airport building. There was no queue - it was still pretty early in the
morning. He got into the first cab and said the address that was 5 blocks away
from his actual destination. The driver doesn't need to know where he's
heading - the less traces he leaves the better. That's why he never used UBER
or other mobility providers.

After around 40 minutes of driving, he got of at the [Dohány Street
Synagogue](https://goo.gl/maps/HZzWGBmWhvyg5uQT7). From here he needed around
10 minutes to the coffee shop. Although he mind was constantly busy, he really
enjoyed walking the streets of this beautiful city. It reminded him of all the
countless walks he took when he was growing up in Saint-Petersburg.

He entered to Café, went straight to the counter, ordered an espresso and asked
for Serge. The barista told him to take a seat at a window. After 2 minutes the
waitress brought him his coffee. There was a small piece of paper with the
phone number underneath the saucer. He made a phone call. The bot on the other
end asked him for his name. After he went through a set of questions, the
meeting at the [Elisabeth Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/NemzJzJ6sHU1DeCYA) was arranged.

Arthur left the Café and slowly walked towards the bridge. He ripped the piece
of paper in small pieces and threw it into the trash bin. He didn't take the
straigt way along the river but a detour through the smaller streets doing
a lot of turns - it was way easier to check if someone was following him.

He arrived at the bridge and started walking towards [Buda](https://www.contiki.com/six-two/buda-vs-pest-which-side-of-the-river-are-you-on/).
He knew his phone will start buzzing when Serge will be near him. He walked
slowly making stops and enjoying the view from the bridge - he wasn't in
a rush. About half way in his phone started buzzing but there was nobody near
him - he looked to the other side of the bridge and saw a woman walking to
Buda. He followed her but kept walking on his side. He knew he had to get to
the other side at the and of the bridge, otherwise he won't be able to follow
the girl anymore. Once he was close to the end he waited the road to get empty
and rushed to the other side. He saw that the girl slowed down a bit helping
him to follow her. She walked off the bridge, took the firs left where the
parking was. She walked straight to her car, got it and started the engine. He
get into the car on the passenger seat and she immediately started driving.

- Who are you? - he asked
- I will bring you to Serge.

They drove along the Danube in the early dusk not talking. He felt calm as if
all of a sudden he was in a safe place, just enjoying the ride through the
night city.
They took the [Liberty Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/wuxHTyPK3UBrGDV39) back to
Pest and drove straight into the city. After around 10-15 minutes drive she
stopped the car in a very narrow street [Vasvári Pál u. 5](https://goo.gl/maps/tHTYnRDzh5hQbxmA7).

- Get out here - two buildings further, ring the bell with the name Fodor
  Szabó.

He silently left the car and shut the door. The car drove away. He walked for
3 minutes and rang the bell - the door opened. He walked in and heard the voice
from above saying:
- Go up - third floor!



- After meeting Serge they will go to this apartment or walk the streets
- Serge tells him who currently works in the city - Ukranians, Germans,
  Americans, Russians. Hungarians and Croatians are getting involved sometimes.
- Serge will ask him questions about Sasha and if she's really dead (you
  haven't seen the body yourself)
- He will persuade Arthur to either stay at his place or book a hotel for him
- Arthur doesn't want to be tracked, so he wants to get a room in a hotel
  without revealing the name
- Serge tells him to relax - go out and get a drink
- Arthur goes out and meet Nadja who was sent to him
- They speak German, she calls him and her number is the same as the number he
  was called from in SF
- He drags her out of the club kicking some asses on the way
- She gets hit by a car in front of the night club
- Her phone is ringing, Arthur picks up and talks to someone on the other end.
  They tell him that they watch him and that he should be careful. They will
take care of Nadja's body (or not - dunno yet)
- Arthur calls Serge and asked him to get a car for him
- He drives to either Germany or Kiew
---- what questions should he ask: who could it be - what's the number they
called from etc.
