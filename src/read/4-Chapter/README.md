# Chapter 4
He woke up a couple of hours before landing. His co-traveler peacefully slept
on his chair.

He called the flight hostess asked her for a coffee and went to the restroom.
He needed to freshen up after a long flight. He had to be ready to act once the
jet has landed. He won't have a lot of time in Budapest. If someone was trying
a matter of time until they try to get to him again.

So he needed to find his contact in Budapest quickly. Back in
SF Vlad told him that Sergey is the person to talk to. He may potentially have
some ideas about people who are trying to set him up. He is the new man in
town - the one from the mothership.

Vlad worked with Sergey hand in hand for almost a year before he moved to San Francisco. He was handing over Budapest to him - introducing him to all his contacts and revealing all the secret spots. It was a regular procedure whenever a `city owner` was replaced.

So, once they land he will be heading to [Caf√© Gerbeaud](https://gerbeaud.hu/).

---- how should he contact the guy in Budapest from the coffee shop?
---- what questions should he ask: who could it be - what's the number they
called from etc.
