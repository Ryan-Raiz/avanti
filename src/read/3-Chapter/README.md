# Chapter 3
He woke on the couch at around 5am with pumping headache. He went to
the kitchen and fill the big glass with tap water. One tablet of ibuprofen
works wonders. He took on and went to the shower. At 5:30am he was ready to go.
The ibuprofen started to work and the headache softened. It needed another 15
minutes to disappear completely. He knew the coffee will weaken the ibuprofen
effect but he needed his morning dose.

He still had some time to check the local news. He hoped to not find anything
about a dead body found in Marriot at Russian Hill. He opened [SF Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/) and [SFGATE](https://www.sfgate.com/local/) and started to skim over the news.

Unfortunately there was a small piece on the dead body found in a Marriot
Hotel. Do you know this feeling when in the back of your head there's still
a hope that someone made a mistake or that maybe, just maybe it's someone else and not your friend.

He started to feel a bit dizzy but he knew that he has to keep a clear head. He needed to calm down and concentrate. The door bell got him back to consciousness. He went to the door and looked through the peephole. That was Vlad.

> - "Why are you ringing the door bell - it's your house."
> - "I am a well-brought-up boy 😄. Are you ready? We cannot miss the flight
>   and we cannot let your flight buddy wait. Have you checked the news?"
> - "Yes, I did. Do you think it's about her?"
> - "The chances for the opposite are very low - you know that it's quite unrealistic that someone else died in the same
>     hotel at the same day. But don't think about it. Get your bag and let's
>     get going."
> - "Ok, give me a second."

He went to the kitchen and got some water then walked back into the room, shut
his Mac and put it into the backpack.

> - "I'm ready let's go."

He put his stuff on the backseat of the car and they drove off to the airport.

> - "How was your night?"
> - "Mine was awesome as usual - did you expect something else? 😁"
> - "Not really but I still cannot understand how you can deal with the people
>   here and have fun."
> - "It's your soviet childhood talking. I would rather talk to someone, who you
>   would probably call `shallow`, but who's fun and enjoys life than spending
>   time somewhere in a shitty kitchen in a small shitty soviet apartment
>   talking with very smart but wasted people about mistakes Nazi Army made
>   during World War II. Leave your old school way of thinking behind and
>   finally start enjoying the life."
> - "I'm having hard time talking to people who don't know history or geography
>   and acting as if they were the center of the world."
> - "It doesn't work like in the movies, mate, it neve did. Good guys or smartest guys
>   don't win. Ignorant, stupid people who take action win. They don't know
>   history, they create it. Yes, the quality of people dropped significantly
>   lately - god bless tech, but let's be honest 90% of the people are dumb and
>   were dumb always. Smart people are `outliers` - they're not a normality.
>   That's one of the reasons the system doesn't like them. They're hard to
>   control, they're unpredictable."

When they arrived at the Oakland International, Jet was ready to go. Vlad was
faster to say bye:

> - "Take care, mate and don't beat yourself about what happened - it's not
>   your fault."
> - "I feel stupid to say thank you again but thank you!"
> - "Don't thank me. As long as we're on the same side of the war, I'm here to
>   help. We'll see how it will look later."

They hugged and he went to the terminal. The girls was already waiting for him
with the name shield. He went straight to her:

> - "Good morning, I'm Arthur. You look great today!"
> - "Oh, good morning Mr. Arhur. The jet is ready, please follow me."

They went through the building to the airfield, get into a small electric car
and started driving towards the business jet.
