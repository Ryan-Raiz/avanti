# Introduction

Growing up in the Soviet Union and seeing it falling apart taught you a lot
lessons in a very short period of time. It created the whole generation of
people who saw the decay and downfall of an empire, lived through a couple of
revolutions and experienced the country's rise from the ashes.

All these experiences combined with a good portion of bitterness from the gifts
the life gave these people formed a certain world view identified by lack of
trust, cynisism, continuous striving for financial stability and success.
Combine it with the hatred and distrust to almost everything coming from the
West and you will have a good picture of almost any educated Russian in his mid
forties.
