Pieces that will flow into the book at later stages

## Americans
Americans act like kids. A young, pure kid goes around and explore. He tries the world around himself and tries to make an impact. He can grab a cat by the tail, he can play with the frog and kill it accidentally. He's learning, exploring - the kid doesn't know the shame and doesn't know the rules.
So is the American - goes around the world ovethrowing the governments, killing the people with absolutely pure intentions - saving the world.

He didn't know what it has to do with and why the Americans act as if there were no history before them or they didn't bother to learn about it.

But one thing was clear almost every American was absolutely sure that they do the right thing - the `Big Lie` was working.

## 90s in Russia
Looking back at the fall of the Soviet Union and everything that has happened
in the following years, everyone in sane mind understands that it looked like
when Europeans traded glass beads for slaves.

Americans and Europenas behaving like vultures were trying to get anything they
could from the country on the verge of dying in exchange for [Snickers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snickers)
and [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(chocolate_bar)) bars.

These were were pretty surreal times: every second person was out of job, there
were no law enforcement, almost every kid was dreaming of joining a gang.

He remembered how he had to hide at his grandmas because of a car accident
where his dad scratched an expensive car, so they weren't sure if the gang
members will visit them to put an iron on their chests.

He also remembered working in a private hotel that was owned by a smaller gang
where his work was helping out in the kitchen, serving the food and fishing out
condoms out of the swimming pool.

That was where he earned his first money and bought a Turkish made [Chicago
Bulls](https://www.nba.com/bulls/) hoodie. They loved basketball. The best trio
in history of basketball: Jordan, Pippen and Rodman.

## A Price of Mistake
When he was working in Germany for different startups he was always wondering
why every decision took so much time. It seemed that everyone was afraid to
make a decision.
One lead software engineer told him once:
> You make a mistake you're in it by yourself. It's solitary. I've been in there twice. Don't like it. Don't plan on making any more mistakes.

These words explained a lot about Germans and their constant longing for
a "FÃ¼hrer", who will take the burden of decision making and [Angst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angst) of
failure off their shoulders.

## James Bond
He really enjoyed James Bond movies. Primarily due to the fact that they had
absolutely nothing to do with reality.

You would be absolutely delluded to believe that
[MI6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service) would keep and
employ an agent who goes around the world blowing up cities, leaving piles of
dead bodies behind him. All of that is done by an agent whose name and face is
known by basically everyone.

[James Bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond) has become the British version of Captain America, which wasn't intended by [Ian Flemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Fleming) but with wide spread of American Culture (a term that rather sounds like an [oxymoron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymoron)) the level of products of fictional arts like movies and books had a significant drop in quality.

A modern consumer is not ready to think - he's busy looking for the gems worth
sharing on [instagram](https://instagram.com) in the sad line of events he's calling life.

As you probably may think a good `part of the system` is someone you would never think of as
one. They mustn't caught your eye, they mustn't stand out. In San Francisco it
will be a guy wearing a t-shirt, a pair of jeans and vans shoes. In New York it
can be a girl wearing a suit, working in Wall Street or a hipster guy living
and working in [Williamsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg,_Brooklyn).

Whenever you join a system (any system), you should aware of certain rules:
- **Everyone is replaceable and disposable** - it doesn't matter how important
  you think you are - when you're out the system will keep working.
- **System will always win** - you can kid yourself into thinking you can fight
  the system - don't.
- **You can only exit one system by entering another**

# The Idea
The idea is always bigger than an individual or even an organization. The idea
is the main base for all good and all evil in this world.

Once you expressed your idea and made it public it doesn't belong to you
anymore.

The funny thing though is that the source of every idea is the hunger for power
that every individual carries with himself since his childhood.

The most influential people are most of the times the ones who either didn't
get enough attention in their childhood or were bullied in their teens. The
desire the most to show the world that they can crush their offenders and got
all the girls/guys they were ignored by.

# Ass
> - "You've been with the company long enough and should know that there's no such
thing as `our people`. We have a very good relationship but when MOM will force
me to choose between my ass and yours, I will prefer mine any time of the day - I like my ass ðŸ˜‰."
> - "Yeah, I know, exactly as the half of gay Frisco."
